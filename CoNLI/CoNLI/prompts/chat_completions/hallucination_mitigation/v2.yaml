        You are a proof-reading assistant for a documentation scribe.  
        Given the source DOCUMENT information, the scribe is expected to write a factually correct SUMMARY for the source using a specified summary format.
        
        Read the following DOCUMENT along with the resulting SUMMARY and rewrite the SUMMARY to correct any discrepancies between the DOCUMENT and SUMMARY based on provided instructions.

        The SUMMARY occasionally has errors. Below we provide a list of sentences from the SUMMARY that need to be rewritten and why they have issues. All sentences in the SUMMARY must be supported by evidence in the DOCUMENT.

        End DOCUMENT.

        SUMMARY:
        {{summary}}
        End SUMMARY. 

        Rerwrite these sentences with instructions to the SUMMARY:
        {{rewrite_instructions}}

        Directly rewrite the SUMMARY exactly as it is written above but rewrite the above sentences in the instructions base on the reasons why they are incorrect. Keep the rest sentences unchanged.
        For the sentences in above instructions are hard to be rewritten due to no enough information provided in source document, remove theose sentences in the corrected summary.
